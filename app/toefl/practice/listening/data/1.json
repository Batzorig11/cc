Early telephones used wired connections, and communication was limited to short distances.\nIn the 20th century, the introduction of automatic telephone exchanges improved call quality and made the system faster. By the 1980s, mobile phones appeared, although they were large and expensive.\nThe 21st century brought smartphones, combining telecommunication with computing power. Modern smartphones now include high-speed internet, cameras, and advanced applications, transforming global communication.",
